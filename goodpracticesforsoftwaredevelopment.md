# Good Practices for Software Development


## Which point(s) were new to you?

The following points were new to me:

    Using screenshots, diagrams, or screencasts like Loom: While I’ve shared issues before, I hadn’t considered using visual aids to clarify problems more effectively.
    **Blocking social media sites during work hours:** I knew about managing distractions but hadn't thought of using tools like Freedom or TimeLimit to enforce boundaries proactively.
    **Joining meetings early for informal chats:** The idea of using this time to build rapport with teammates is something I hadn't explicitly thought of before.

## Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

**Area for Improvement:** Over-communicating with teammates.

**Ideas for Progress:**

    **Keep Relevant Stakeholders Updated:** I will make it a habit to provide regular updates when delays or changes occur, using group channels like Slack or Microsoft Teams.
    **Responding Promptly:** I’ll ensure I respond to messages and calls quickly, even if it’s to acknowledge and schedule a follow-up.
    **Practice Structured Communication:** When asking for help, I will clearly explain the problem, share what I’ve tried, and provide supporting screenshots or links to make it easier for others to assist.
    **Use Video in Meetings:** Turning on my video during meetings to improve engagement and team rapport is something I plan to prioritize.
